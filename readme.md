# What is this?
To make my [personal website](https://nishanthjkumar.com), I cloned and customized the amazing [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/) (so most of the credit for all of this should rightly go to him!). To make it easier for others looking to build a website similar to mine, this repo contains a barebones version of my website that you can just download and customize with your information! You're welcome.

# Installation
Just clone this repo to your local machine!

To run a local version of the site, you'll need Ruby, Bundler and Jekyll (look [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/) for troubleshooting help).

Run `bundle install` on this repo to install necessary gems, then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run a local server with your website. You should then be able to pull it up in your favorite browser!

# Usage / Customization
I'd probably start customizing by editing the `_config.yml` file as described [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/). You'll find the homepage at `index.md`, the blog index page at `/blog/index.html` and the template research page at `/_pages/research.md`.

If you'd like to add a favicon, you'll have to follow the steps [here](https://www.cross-validated.com/Personal-website-with-Minimal-Mistakes-Jekyll-Theme-HOWTO-Part-IV/). I'd also recommend reading the above article to add things like SEO, etc. to your site!
